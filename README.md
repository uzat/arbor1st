üå≥ ArborIQ Project Overview (Full Production Specification)

Working Title: ArborIQ (alt. Arbor1st)
Domain: Arborist tools for tree monitoring, diagnostics, and risk management
Deployment Region: Starting on the Mornington Peninsula, scalable nationally
Parent Portfolio: TechSpring

üéØ Product Vision

ArborIQ provides arborists, councils, and land managers with a complete, production-grade platform for tree inventory, diagnostics, and proactive risk management. It integrates field capture, AI-powered health analysis, geospatial boundaries, weather-driven risk forecasting, drone/NDVI inputs, and planning/development impact tools into a single, reliable system.

The guiding principle: build once, build properly ‚Äî robust engineering, defensible data, and scalable architecture.

üìå Core Use Cases
1. Tree Inventory & Inspections

Create tree records with GPS, QR/NFC, photos, structured inspections.

Species suggestion via iNaturalist + Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).

Health advisory via Plant.id.

Record condition, defects, risk rating, recommended works.

Full inspection history with audit trail.

2. Geo-Fenced Property Boundaries

Define boundaries by drawing or importing polygons.

Auto-associate all trees inside a boundary.

Subdivide into operational zones (campground, schoolyard).

Property-specific reports and exports.

3. Predictive Risk Forecasting

Cross-check inspection risk data against BOM weather forecasts.

Flag vulnerable trees ahead of storms.

Allow exclusion zones around high-risk trees.

Log all risk events for liability defensibility.

4. Planning & Development Impact

Draw or upload proposed development footprints.

Identify impacted trees, including heritage-listed.

Generate AS 4970‚Äì2009 compliant reports.

Track approvals, permits, removals.

5. Drone Inspections & NDVI

Upload drone imagery/video for inspection records.

Ingest NDVI raster data (GeoTIFF).

Overlay NDVI vegetation health maps.

Compute canopy stress indices for dense tree areas.
