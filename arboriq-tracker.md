## 🚨 Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Azure setup delays | High | Low | Early infrastructure setup |
| External API limits | Medium | Medium | Implement caching early |
| PostGIS performance | High | Low | Spatial indexing in design |
| Mobile offline sync complexity | High | Medium | Prototype early, test thoroughly |

---

## 📞 Key Decisions Needed

1. **OAuth Provider**: Auth0 vs Azure AD B2C vs Cognito
2. **Mobile Distribution**: App Store strategy
3. **Staging Environment**: Separate subscription or same?
4. **Team Composition**: Confirm velocity assumptions

## 💡 Notes & Comments

- All tasks have been broken down to 3 story points or less for better manageability
- Technical architecture is fully documented and ready for review
- Ready to begin development once team is assembled and infrastructure decisions are made
